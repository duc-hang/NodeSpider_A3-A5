                        white-space: word-wrap;">The potential impact of these developments could lead to a higher standard of cyber security. In turn, it will increase demand for security intelligence and talent. Companies may open up more cyber security roles or invest more in staff with the right skillset. Improving cyber security in companies will also benefit end users by securing their data.

Cyber security will be able to help everyone since it allows users and businesses to access the internet without having to factor in the possible consequences regarding any malicious intention that attackers may have. It can successfully change IP addresses and hide ISP information (Internet service Provider). Additionally, cyber security encrypts any sort of transaction to make sure it is not tracked by anyone and secures this data from anyone else’s perspective. This would provide businesses and individuals with a safe platform from other users whilst being able to access all existing data.

However, cyber attacks are always up to date with their exploits and it is fairly easy to break through new systems/platforms. Companies today are not afraid to invest in hackathons and make sure those vulnerabilities are found through constant ethical hacking, helping developers patch weak points of a system quicker than a malicious hacker can exploit it. Big tech firms like Apple offer generous “bounties” for those who find bugs in their operating systems.

Since there is a limit to how much technology can do by itself, it is important to know that sophisticated cyber attackers will break through the barriers eventually if they are not updated to meet the latest security requirements. Therefore, a need for security intelligence is required. Technology has its weaknesses, and attackers will take advantage of any possible opening that they can access, so it is important to identify and address them swiftly and efficiently. Since the safety requirements are only increasing as time goes on because of the increased digital use, more anomalies are occurring, thus creating more job opportunities in the field of cyber intelligence.

                    <h1><u>CYBER SECURITY</u></h1>
                    <h4>Cyber security involves the protection of devices and networks from damage and attacks. Internet users may fall victim to Credential stuffing, Spear phishing and Ransomwares. These cases often involve stealing sensitive information through hacking (Trustware 2020).

                        Since the start of Covid-19, there has been an increasing number of people working from home. As a result, data breaches have doubled; web attacks in the gaming scene increased over 300% due to malicious hacking (Akamai 2021). Hence, companies have to remain vigilant in order to prevent sensitive information taken by hackers.
                         
                        For better protection, it is important to know what types of cyber security there are. Some examples would be critical infrastructure security, network security, application security, information security, cloud security, data loss prevention, and end-user education. An explanation for each of these terms is listed below (Akamai 2021).
                        
                        
                       </h4><h4> •	Critical infrastructure security: cyber-physical systems such as electricity grid and water purification systems (Johansen 2020).</h4>
                       <h4> •	Network security: Protects internal networks from intruders by securing infrastructure. Examples of network security include the implementation of two-factor authentication and new, strong passwords (Johansen 2020).</h4>
                       <h4>•	Application security: Uses software and hardware to defend against external threats that may present themselves in an application’s development stage. Examples of application security include antivirus programs, firewalls, and encryption (Johansen 2020).</h4>
                       <h4>•	Information security: Also known as InfoSec, which protects both physical and digital data from unauthorised access, use, change, disclosure, deletion, or other forms of malintent (Johansen 2020).</h4>
                       <h4>•	Cloud security: A software-based tool that protects and monitors your data in the cloud, to help eliminate risks associated with on-premise attacks (Johansen 2020).</h4>
                       <h4>•	Data loss prevention: developing policies and processes for handling and preventing the loss of data and developing recovery policies in the event of a cyber security breach. This includes setting network permissions and policies for data storage (Johansen 2020).</h4>
                       <h4> •	End-user education: teaching users to follow best practices such as not clicking on unknown links or downloading suspicious attachments in emails, which may include malware and other forms of malicious software (Johansen 2020).</h4>
                         
                       <h4> An example of good cyber security involves Nord VPN, which provides the services stated above. It also provides a secure, encrypted tunnel for online traffic flow. Additionally, it secures personal information and work files and encrypts your internet connection so you can connect to public WiFi while keeping your browsing history private (NordVPN 2021).
                         
                        While researching future investments for cyber security, we found out that machine learning is making progress within the online industry but still needs an ongoing investment. From our perspective, we see a lot of potential; it just needs better automation and predictive reasoning, so artificial intelligence (AI) still has room for promise (Trustware 2021). We expect that in 25 years, it will become a lot more commercialised; it will be expected that AI will be able to predict behavior patterns if it needs to. Therefore, if a large company such as Tesla was to invest into AI, the impact it would have on the economic side would be dramatic. This is due to the fact that AI can dramatically improve efficiency of workplaces, in addition to contributing indirectly to other areas, like cybersecurity (Trustware 2021).
                        
                        As of now, we have seen tighter security incorporated into everyday product offerings. This is due to cloud providers, such as Microsoft and Google, improving security measures at a remarkably high level that was traditionally available only through third-party solutions. With innovation, more things can be automated (Trustware 2020).
                        
                        The plethora of security products and measures in place in SaaS (Software as a Service) cloud products means that it is becoming increasingly more difficult for individuals, businesses and even CISOs, to keep track of all the different levels of security in place. Consolidation of security measures is already happening — a great example is Single Sign On (SSO) in conjunction with API integrations in multiple platforms, which reduces password fatigue and consolidates the user to log in with one set of credentials on an array of SaaS products.
                         </h5>
                         <h4><u>How will this affect you in your daily life? How might this affect your family and friends? </u></h4>
                         <h4>Keeping abreast of the latest developments in cyber security would be crucial to protect ourselves as threats will continue to evolve. For example, end users will have to know steps to secure their data, such as adding Two-factor authentication (2FA) to accounts. In addition, students would have to consider if their field of studies will remain relevant and essential for an IT-savvy world. We may have to change credential information monthly and not access suspicious websites.

                            This extra layer of protection will be useful because ever since the Covid-19 outbreak, we have been using technology more frequently. This means that transactions or websites will regularly be looked over by the IT security team. Having more advanced cyber security can also provide a layer of protection when doing any sort of transaction, be it over the internet or crypto. As time goes on, the demand for cyber security will increase, which will lead to a higher salary and the need for a certain skill set (Institute of Data, 2019). Hence, growth in the field of cybersecurity can lead to more job opportunities in the near future, which is beneficial to businesses and individuals. However, the time required for upskilling can easily be the cause of individuals spending less time with their loved ones. This will not only cause stress for the individual but for the families involved as well.

                            white-space: word-wrap;">The greatest impact of having a more capable robot would be the effect on human labour. According to a recent study titled Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets (2020), robots not only displaced approximately 400,000 jobs in the US up until today, but also decreased wages for the existing workforce by 0.42%. 

Deploying a more advanced and capable robot would likely add to these figures. There is also the flip side to this argument, where robots will create more skilled jobs. Jobs for skilled workers will be created to perform the required programming, design and ongoing maintenance required for this type of equipment. However, this argument serves little meaning to those who will lose their jobs to automation. The tasks the robots are designed to carry out may inevitably replace the humans that once performed these duties.

                        <h1><u>ROBOTS</u></h1>
                        <h4>This section will focus on the most widely used robots throughout the world, the industrial robot (Wikipedia Contributors 2021). According to Statista (2021), there were approximately 2.72 million industrial robots in operation globally in 2019. The industrial robot performs pre-programmed, automated tasks. The most common tasks include palletising, packaging and labelling, product testing, painting, welding and assembling (Acemoglu and Restrepo 2017). These operations are achieved largely by a robot that has a wide range of freedom of movement, the articulated arm robot. Having a similar shape to a human arm, it can range from working with up to 10-axis points of rotation, making it a versatile piece of equipment for a number of different operations in the manufacturing industry.
  
                            Due to advancements in technology along with its lightweight, more capable construction, is the CoBot. The CoBot is tipped to have the biggest growth in the field of industrial robots; it is a robot that collaborates with humans. It has also eliminated the need to run the robot inside a bulky safety cage and has the added ability of ‘learning’ while on the job. 
                            
                            This means the robot can be easily re-taught by the human collaborator by moving the robot arm along a new desired path. The robot then remembers this path and repeats its steps. 
                            This is a tremendous advancement when compared to the standard industrial robot, which requires a new path to be reprogrammed by an engineer — a long and costly exercise. 
                            Another state of art feature for the industrial robot is the addition of vision systems. 
                            Vision systems increase functionality by allowing robots to perform new tasks such as picking parts from a moving conveyor and using the vision system to allow the robot to make decisions based on the object in front of it.  
                             
                            The collaboration of AI and robots is currently being developed and tested, the merging of these two technologies looks to be the focus in the industry over the next few years. Teaming robots with AI will allow robots to teach themselves how to handle new objects and open the possibilities of decision making based on the environment. For example, this would mean managing obstacle avoidance and creating an alternative route to continue the task at hand without the need to stop or have an operator intervene. Arguably, the biggest benefit will be the ability for the robot to learn from its mistakes, allowing it to solve a wide array of tasks.
                             
                            The technological development that makes this possible is the advancements in machine learning in recent times. While machine learning is nothing new, its recent capabilities and success is what makes designers and creators of new technology expand its uses and develop new applications for the technology. Another development that requires the advancement in this technology is the increased manufacturing rates throughout the world and the need to run manufacturing plants 24/7. Robots are an obvious choice for this work and can be seen in reports by the International Federation of Robotics (2020), showing an increase in installations from 60,000 units worldwide in 2009 to 422,000 units in 2018. This supply and demand give companies a greater incentive to build the latest and greatest robots on the market.
                             </h5>
                             <h4><u>How will this affect you in your daily life? How might this affect your family and friends? </u></h4>
                             <h4>As the world’s technology advances, there will be people of all ages who can adapt and upskill themselves, and many others who will struggle with change. Those who will benefit from technological advancements would be individuals with skilled jobs in a relevant field and business owners, as automation will increase levels of production and efficiency. The ones who will not benefit and, in some cases, face the biggest challenges are those whose jobs will be replaced by robots. For example, an automotive assembly manufacturer may choose to employ a robot to perform the painting and welding tasks that an employee once carried out. Business owners may find robots better ‘employees’ if they can perform tasks smoothly without sleep or human error. Furthermore, robots can do dangerous tasks, reducing workplace hazards for humans. 
 
                                One of our team members, Jason, works in Industrial Automation; he finds that such changes will have a positive effect on his field of work. The more businesses invest in automation, such as robotics, the greater the need for workers with the knowledge to keep these types of technologies operational and optimised. This increased demand brings more jobs. If these jobs cannot be filled, the need to entice suitable candidates will grow, leading to higher salary offers for skilled workers. This can provide the possibility for a higher paying job with greater job security. 
                                
                                However, with the need to upskill, workers may spend more time away from family to obtain the required skills and knowledge. In return, the stress on career advancements may be detrimental to a healthy work-life balance as families spend more time apart. Students and working adults would also have to consider if their choice of studies or jobs will continue to remain relevant or even exist in the years to come.

                                white-space: word-wrap;">The likely impact generated as a result of machine learning and artificial intelligence systems will be felt across almost every area of society. From a societal viewpoint, human behavior will, and has already begun to change (Marr n.d). The need for face-to-face interaction has already begun to diminish as communication can be more easily achieved via technology. This has already begun to result in a higher prevalence of mental health issues as a result of alienation, which ignores the biological need for human closeness (Marr n.d)

Economically, most of these impacts will affect larger scale businesses and industries as predictive maintenance algorithms allow for more efficient processes, the production of greater yields and the recognition of production faults (Clark 2020). Artificial intelligence can also dramatically influence workplace efficiency by increasing repetitive tasks as well as taking on the more dangerous tasks (Marr n.d). As a result, some occupations have been greatly reduced if not made redundant altogether. These include roles such as accounting clerks, auditing clerks and bookkeepers (Australian Institute of Machine Learning 2021). However, this transition allows humans to work primarily in the more creative fields, as AI does not have this capability (Marr n.d). Because of this, many new occupations have been created, which are often higher paid (Australian Institute of Machine Learning 2021).

In the healthcare system for example, AI can provide a more personalized treatment plan, while giving access to an informed information network through superior monitoring and diagnostics (Marr n.d).  Impacts on the marketing industry provide another example as artificial intelligence plays a role in the identification of a valuable customer source, improvement of sales results and personalizing the marketing experience (Clark 2020).

“Those sectors of the economy that are dependent on people maintain a relatively high share of the economy as the price of more automated goods and services drop” (Australian Institute of Machine Learning 2021, pg. 3, para. 2). An example of this occurrence, known as the Baumol effect, can be seen by looking at the relative cost of food, which has decreased dramatically because of greater efficiency in the sector through automation services (Australian Institute of Machine Learning 2021). According to the Australian Institute of Machine Learning (2021), other areas unable to be automated, such as plumbing or building, remain heavily reliant on human labour and their cost remains comparatively high. Despite automation, labour will continue to maintain its share in the economy, although many industries will take on a different ratio of automation and human labour going into the future (Australian Institute of Machine Learning 2021).

                            <h1><u>MACHINE LEARNING</u></h1>
                            <h4>Machine learning is a field of technology that uses self-improving algorithms to gain information and learn from a subject.  Furthermore, machine learning algorithms are designed to self-improve as they gain more data and experience from the subject, therefore able to make better overall predictions (Mathworks n.d.).

                                Machine learning algorithms primarily use two main learning techniques: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning algorithms function by receiving knowledge from labeled data (known data). This knowledge is then paired with a known set of responses in order to build a model to make predictions about any new unlabeled data being introduced. 
                                This process is done through the use of classification and regression techniques and can be used to predict things such as email spam, changes in temperature, speech and facial recognition (Mathworks n.d.). 
                                
                                By contrast, unsupervised learning algorithms search for patterns and information on unlabeled data. Through the use of clustering techniques, these algorithms are then able to predict things such as gene sequence analysis, areas in market research, and object recognition (Mathworks n.d.).
                                 
                                Although true artificial intelligence (interpreted as being comparable to the human mind) remains out of grasp for the moment, state of the art machine learning can be currently seen taking on various applications in a wide variety of industries and usages (Foote 2021).
                                Some examples of these new technological applications include, but are certainly not limited to: 
                                 
                                •	Virtual assistants:  Machine based virtual assistants represent the epitome of state of the art, as they are one of the most innovative examples of artificial intelligence on the market to date. They currently have the capability of interpreting basic commands as well as storing and recollecting a large vocabulary. Furthermore virtual assistants are being used for aiding in daily tasks, such as setting reminders, making calls, note taking and managing to do lists (Foote 2021). 
                                •	Chatbots: Although Chatbots share similarities to virtual assistants in that they both share a high modality range and possess an ability to understand human language, their function is more rudimentary. Their purpose, simply speaking, is to act as an informational kiosk. As a result, chatbot responses are more limited in some ways but are most used for online customer support, providing directions, and answering phone calls with a basic selection of responses. These are usually an organisations first encounter of machine-based learning as a result of being more user friendly. (Foote 2021).
                                •	Natural language processing: “Natural language processing (NLP) is concerned with programming computers to process and analyze data that has been presented in the form of human language.” (Foote 2021, para. 9). This allows a computer to comprehend and receive verbal commands, therefore effectively allowing humans to communicate with machines (Foote 2021).
                                •	ML Algorithms for Writing ML Algorithms: Due to having a limited number of data scientists in fields, machine learning algorithms are being used to make better machine learning algorithms. The use of this technology is enabling businesses to solve complex problems more easily. In conjunction, the high level of automation which can also help to decrease human error, allows a more user-friendly approach and less technical machine learning applications (Foote 2021).
                                
                                Areas that will most likely see changes in the next few years as a result of improvements in ML include the transportation, manufacturing, healthcare, education, media and customer service industries (Thomas 2021). In transportation, the use of autonomous vehicles will become more common and will be more widely available to consumers (Thomas 2021). 
                                
                                In the manufacturing industry, AI powered robots will have an increased role working alongside humans to assemble and stack products (Thomas 2021). The healthcare industry will see various improvements such as a speedier rate of diagnoses with a higher level of accuracy, as well as the introduction of AI nurses, which have the ability to monitor patients 24/7 (Thomas 2021). In Education we will see early-stages of virtual tutors to assist human teachers as well as efforts to improve student experiences such as monitoring facial analysis (Thomas 2021). The Media industry will likely see a steady increase of the use of ML data analysis systems, which in combination with continued improvements to these systems, will allow a greater amount of information to be consumed and produced (Thomas 2021). In the customer service sector, AI assistants will play a larger role in the industry, completing tasks such as making phone calls and booking appointments for customers (Thomas 2021).
                                
                                The development of these technologies that will be used to aid and replace humans in the workforce, requires a level of intelligence that is human-like, if not better in some areas of thinking and processing information. This is where the goal for a true AI system (a computer or program that thinks and communicates like human beings) has come to exist in our society. The achievement of this level of intelligence requires a variety of ML programs, known as subprograms, that work together to support the goal of true AI (Foote 2021).
                                
                                In order to reach this goal, it is essential that further advancements in the field of ML take place and these programs are then integrated into our systems (Foote 2021). As we continue to advance our civilization, through continual improvements in the field of technology, these ML program's abilities to self-improve and collect more data will soon achieve these developments in technology (Foote 2021).

                                 <h4><u>How will this affect you in your daily life? How might this affect your family and friends? </u></h4>
                                 <h4>Machine learning is becoming present in almost every area of our lives. From a social and recreational perspective, machine learning aids in a more personalized digital media experience from social media platforms, internet browsing and movie and music apps such as Spotify and Netflix (Singh 2020). Although this makes for an overall more enjoyable experience on these platforms, one of the potential downsides of this relates to data privacy issues of which true regulation is missing as many countries are still grappling to create a formal national strategy for Artificial intelligence (Australian Institute of Machine Learning 2021).
                                    From a domestic perspective, machine learning is becoming more widely present in the form of integrated alarm systems which are used to build a virtual catalogue of frequent visitors, call emergency services and provide digital assistance (Singh 2020). I have contemplated the use of these technologies before and know of many people who do use these forms.
                                    From an economic perspective, machine learning and automation has been on the rise, the origin of which can be traced all the way back to the industrial revolution. While some occupations have admittedly been lost to automation, many have benefited (Australian Institute of Machine Learning 2021). Furthermore, many new educational and career pathways have been created as a result. An example of this is within the food industry, which affects us all. According to the Australian Institute of Machine Learning (2021) automation and ML has been more integrated, we are able to produce larger crops with a greater yield, thereby providing food sources that were previously scarce out of season, and lowering the overall cost of food.

                                    white-space: word-wrap;">Blockchain technology could improve efficiencies in supply chains, how contracts are managed, and the security of financial transactions. Tracking products and services has an economic potential of USD $962 billion (PwC 2020). In the agriculture sector, tracing goods from the start of the supply chain to the end user increases accountability for companies to provide safe and sustainable goods to consumers and prevent contamination that has previously caused harm or death to people (Openlink 2021). This technology could create or improve the productivity of jobs in supply chain and logistics to avoid time-wasting activities. Apart from the agriculture sector, Blockchain technology can also improve the traceability of welfare and unemployment benefits to improve the distribution of benefits in society (CB 2021).
Blockchain is a decentralised ledger that only allows verified transactions to be uploaded and linked to the chain. A secure, reliable and decentralised system such as blockchain has become more attractive than traditional banks as it decreases the complexity of processes such as transferring money. Blockchain technology also processes payments, transfers of money and provides loans and credits faster than traditional banks through the use of its secure technology and avoiding the need for “gatekeepers” (CB 2021).

                                <h1><u>BLOCKCHAIN AND CRYPTO</u></h1>
                                <h4>Blockchain is a database used by cryptocurrency to decentralise access to data stored on the database. Decentralisation allows the information to be stored on various nodes (computers) instead of one corporation or company such as a bank. In addition, transactions are made public. The benefit of a decentralised database is transparency. Once information has been recorded on a blockchain and a transaction has been created, it cannot be reversed, adjusted, altered, or owned by any one node. The more users adopt blockchain, the higher the security of the technology increases as more transactions are being created. In return, it will less likely be able to be hacked or altered (Euromoney 2020).
  
                                    Due to the nature of blockchain, governments are exploring the possibility of using the technology to incorporate into society for reasons such as voting in elections. Secure technology such as blockchain can reduce fraudulent voting or tampering with ballots, and eliminate the need for human vote counting (Conway 2021). 
                                    
                                    IBM (2021) has adopted blockchain technology to create a collaborative supply chain network to improve “visibility and accountability” of their procurement processes. This technology could eliminate contaminated produce caused by disease outbreaks and hazardous materials. Blockchain technology improves traceability to easily identify these issues and control the risks (Conway 2021). Banks can also use this technology to continuously process transactions 24 hours, 7 days a week, as opposed to the traditional brick and mortar times of 9-5pm. Smart contracts is a blockchain as-a-service model and can also be integrated into blockchains to “facilitate, verify, or negotiate contract agreement” (Conway 2021). This code is a “business automation application” (Mearian 2019) that improves communication (Sahu 2020) and is used as an intermediary for secure transactions, whether it is for shipment handovers or house leases. Blockchain as-a-service has been used to substitute the need for infrastructure and human skills. The implementation of blockchain as-a-service allows organisations to speed up the pace of transactions where certain resources are not available. 
                                    
                                    IBM’s “blockchain-based solution” (Marr 2021) has been used to track critical pharmaceutical goods to ensure safe and efficient transportation from its source to the end user. Currently, trials are conducted to track and monitor vaccines to ensure a specific temperature is maintained during its transportation phase so that the efficacy is not compromised (Marr 2021). NFTs is another blockchain technology that has recently been more widely adopted to certify and authenticate ownership of tangible and intangible goods. Technology innovations, a larger adoption from users and large corporation backings can make the development of blockchain technology possible (Technologies 2021).

                                     <h4>Increasing visibility and traceability of the foods we eat reassures us that contamination can be identified and controlled before it reaches consumers. This also allows consumers that are concerned with the contents and sustainability of how their foods are sourced to easily track the movements of the foods they are consuming. 
                                        Overall, we are positive about the effects blockchain technology can provide to society. Increased security and validity in financial transactions also reassure us that our money transfers are safe and can be processed quickly. Blockchain technology will allow us to transfer money to families living overseas in seconds without a third party and without additional administrative costs that we have had to endure. Moreover, Blockchain has the ability to address security issues to protect information and user data. I believe the development of this technology will improve the standard of living among our family and friends through its ability to address modern challenges of cyber security and internet banking.

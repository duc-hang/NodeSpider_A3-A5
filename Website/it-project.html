                <h3 style="text-align: justify;font-family: Roboto;color:white">As a team, we discussed everyone’s project idea from Assignment 1. 
                    <h3 style="text-align: justify;font-family: Roboto;color:white">Collectively, we decided to expand on one member’s idea — a Smart Mailbox/Parcel Notifier. The Smart Mailbox leverages your existing mailbox and home Wi-Fi internet to send you notifications whenever someone interacts with your mailbox or delivers letters and parcels.</h3>

                    <h3 style="text-align: justify;font-family: Roboto;color:white">A mobile application installed on your smartphone will send notifications about any event happening in your mailbox. You will also be able to track mailbox trends such as which day of the week has the highest triggers. There will be a custom speaker fitted next to the sensor that will also let you play a custom audio file on the mailbox trigger.</h3> 
                    <h3 style="text-align: justify;font-family: Roboto;color:white" >Expanding on this idea, we look to have a product which would include a stainless steel wall-mounted parcel box. On top of the sensors fitted inside, there will be a button for the courier to push, which then sends new parcel alerts via push notifications on your phone. 
                    
                    Upon verification from a snapshot taken by the camera fitted on top, you can approve or reject this request. Approving it will let the motorized locking mechanism unlock itself for the courier to drop the parcel safely. 
                    
                    This project's core system is a micro-controller with a Wi-Fi module, a speaker, a camera, and a smartphone app.

                <h3 style="text-align: justify;font-family: Roboto;color:white">The Smart Mailbox is fairly large to accommodate up to medium-sized parcels. It can be wall-mounted or screwed to the ground for added security. The box can withstand abuse from being outdoors, which will ensure letters and parcels are free from humidity and dust.</h3>
                    <h3>Unlike a traditional parcel box/mailbox, the Smart Mailbox is equipped with light, motion and temperature sensors. In addition, data can be checked at any time through the companion app on your phone. If the box is getting too humid or too warm, you will be notified without having to query the app.</h3>
                <h3>Attached on top of the Smart Mailbox would be a camera, motion sensor, speaker, and a button for couriers to press during delivery. Optionally, a mini solar panel could be installed.
                <h3>The camera will get triggered whenever the motion sensor is triggered, which will then send a push notification to your phone so you will know who is in front of your mailbox.</h3>
                <h3>   The solar panel will help recharge the batteries for the Smart Mailbox to operate without having to recharge it. If needed, the batteries can be manually recharged using a Micro-USB cable hook to a power adapter (similar to a phone charger). Charging times are similar to charging your phone back to 100%.</h3>
            <h3>   An easy-to-use app will be downloaded on your smartphone of choice (Android or iOS), and the pairing process is very simple. All you need to do is to initialise a Bluetooth connection to the device, which in return will let you enter your Home WiFi password to let it connect to the internet.</h3>
        <h3>Once set up, push notifications will be automatically delivered to you whenever the mailbox is being triggered. When a courier pushes the button on top of your parcel box, it will ring your phone to tell you to accept or reject the request to open the box. You will get a snapshot from the camera as well, so you know exactly who triggered the button.</h3>
    <h3> When accepted, the motorised locking mechanism inside the box will unlock the parcel box's door and a notification sound will be played through the speaker, letting the courier know that the box can be opened and the parcel dropped inside.</h3>
                    
    <h3> A data warehouse in the cloud will keep all your data for the week. It will be able to tell you which time and day of the week was the most humid and warm, via accessible reports from the smartphone app. It will also tell you the amount of parcels and letters you have received and how many motion events have been triggered.</h3>
                    
    <h3>The mailbox notifier system never rests and will monitor your mailbox throughout the night, in case thieves or little animals try to get in. </h3>
                    
    <h3>Some challenges that will need to be overcome during the development of this product is the configuration/setup of the complete unit to find the perfect parcel box for the project. The use of a 3D printer gives flexibility in being able to produce a number of different size cases to fit the microcontroller and sensor/miscellaneous components.</h3>
                    
    <h3>Another challenge the team will face is pushing their programming skills to new levels when programming and developing the microcontroller program. We believe the choice of a microcontroller, along with the chosen language, requires a wealth of knowledge and support online that will aid the team in bringing this part of the project to life.</h3>
                    
    <h3> A smart home device would not be complete without its very own app and will arguably give the team the greatest challenge in the development of the product. To overcome this, the development of the app will be broken into manageable steps, outlined in the below sections.

                <div style="text-align: justify;">
                <h3>The demand for Home Automation has drastically increased in the past decade. According to Forbes (2020), the smart-home device market is set to grow from $55 billion in 2016 to $174 billion by 2025. With the increasingly popular IoT (Internet of Things) devices becoming increasingly mainstream and affordable, turning everyday objects in your home into smart devices has become a trend. 

                    However, the physical mailbox does not have a lot of automation broadly available in the current market. Hence, we think there is a big potential to market an easy-to-install kit to monitor your mailbox wherever you are. Having the ability to monitor your mailbox, in a world where mail could be a source for thieves to obtain information on property occupants, adds an additional layer of security.
                    
                    For parcel notifications, big players such as Google and Amazon leverage their voice assistant platforms (Google Assistant/Alexa) in conjunction with third party doorbell or gate door products such as Ring. However, marketing an affordable, all-in-one Smart Mailbox would introduce a new type of product in the market. It could prove successful as online shopping is extremely popular, especially during a global pandemic. The Smart Mailbox would provide a contactless solution to view and accept your parcel.
                    </h3>

                <u><h1>OUTCOME:</h1></u>
                <div style="text-align: justify;">
                    <h3>Being successful in developing the smart parcel box would enable us to come up with a cost-effective method of keeping your mail and parcels safe, without having to spend thousands on a commercial, ATM-like solution used by big businesses and the likes of Australia Post for their offices.
                        If successful, these Smart Mailboxes could eventually replace the traditional mailbox and even spark ideas for future iterations of the product. We could see online shops such as Amazon or Ebay and delivery companies such as AusPost or DHL being partners and having integrations with the Smart Mailbox.
                        One such integration could be a QR code scanned by the courier, which will check your delivery against the registered ID of your smart parcel box, which in return triggers the box to open up.
                        As a team, we are excited to develop this project idea, since we love online shopping and practical, cost-effective solutions to solve everyday problems. In addition, we will not have to worry about the parcel being left in an unsecure spot or missing the right time to catch our courier. The Smart Parcel Box will take the anxiety out of checking out during online shopping!

                <h3>This project will require multiple components:</h3>
                    <h3>An existing parcel box suitable for the modification in order to produce a working prototype.</h3>
                    <h3>Ideally, a rugged construction would be preferred. It would need to have both a lockable sliding door that can fit medium parcels and a letterbox small enough to slide in most letter formats.</h3>
                    <h3>We recommend a microcontroller, such as an ESP32, that has integrated WiFi and Bluetooth for several reasons:</h3>
                    <h3>A microcontroller is recommended for its robust design. Having the ability to work in temperatures of –40°C to +125°C is an ideal choice for the harsh Australian climate.</h3>
                    <h3>A microcontroller is also a powerful small piece of kit with a dual-core CPU capable of 80, 160 or 240mHz, along with 512KB SRAM on chip memory.</h3>
                    <h3>Power consumption is an important aspect when it comes to designing a standalone device without a hard-wired power source. Using a micro-controller with ultra-low power consumption aids tremendously in length of battery life.</h3>
                    <h3>Microcontrollers can cost as little as a cup of coffee.</h3>
                    <h3>Having built-in WiFi and Bluetooth eliminates the need for any extra radio modules. This has the benefit of keeping the complete kit as small as possible.</h3>
                     
                    <h3>A light sensor, a motion sensor, a moisture sensor, a temperature sensor, a 1080p camera with night vision, and a big rugged push button that can sit on top of the mailbox. We will have to prevent mail from being damaged or ruined by water by receiving feedback on the mailbox environment by using moisture and temperature sensors.</h3>
                    
                    <h3>The motion sensor is used for mail deposit feedback.</h3>
                    <h3>A 3D Printer can create the case for the electronic components.</h3>
                    <h3>To keep the controller free from the elements, it will be housed in a case that can be custom sized to fit all the controller parts.</h3>
                     
                    <h3>Arduino IDE to program the microcontroller.</h3>
                    <h3>With ample support, access to information online and simplicity, make Arduino IDE perfect for the task of programming.</h3>
                     
                    <h3>A Smartphone app (Both deployed to Android/iOS) that will receive data about the sensor, such as notifications and battery life.</h3>
                    
                    <h3>C# language and Xamarin.Forms is the preferred choice of development tools as it can do cross-platform deployment. </h3>
                    
                    <h3>A database server to store the data from the sensor, and in return will let the smartphone app access it.</h3>
